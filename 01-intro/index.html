				<h1>From Runways, to Fashion Editorials, and Instagram Filters</h1>
				<h2>Interrogating the Emergence of Fashion Instagrammers</h2>
				
				<div class="img-gif" style="background-image:url('../assets/img/instagram.gif')">
				</div>
				
				<p>Fashion blogging, once confined to the margins of an obscure Internet coterie, has profoundly risen to the echelons of the fashion elite. This contentious ascent provoked disputes around editorial authority to light, but also broader questions about precarious labour and self-branding. As result, our research looked to move beyond the shallow criticisms of narcissism and conspicuous consumption that plague public perceptions, and strive to develop a more nuanced and critical account of fashion bloggers, appreciating their broad economic, cultural, and political emergence.</p>

				<p>The arrival of fashion blogging into the mainstream occurred during the mid-2000s, when the first generation of fashion bloggers were courted by designer labels and granted access to the prestigious front shows of runways. This initial development was met with polarizing sentiments. Editors and fashion insiders derided this inclusion as amateurish and their presence as tasteless. However, bloggers and their followings applauded the democratizing influence ushered in and the broadening impact of opening fashion shows from the runaways into the living rooms. And while this question of the democratization of fashion elicited passionate responses in the industry, the emergence of Fashion Instagrammers brings forward many profound questions.<p> 

				<p>This app is the culmination of our research on the rise, influence, and consequences of Fashion Instagrammers on the industry. The research centered around four principle narratives, with each attempting to unpackage the complicated set of mediated relations underlying Fashion Instagrammers. Complementing this conceptual research, we undertook a dedicated, small data inquiry. For it, we selected three prominent Fashion Instagrammers and dove into their Instagram feeds and collected their most recent 100 photos posted. This small data set was aimed to complement our theoretical work with concrete insights into how bloggers reconcile their branded identity, as well as the underlying negotiation cultivated between user engagement and corporate sponsorships that underlies the architecture of fashion Instagraming.<p>
