<p><u>Claudia Giralt Monedero</u></p>
<p>Claudia is an artist and designer, also known as A cAt. She studied graphic design in Spain, Digital Media Design in England, with a master in Experimental Publishing, at Piet Zwart, Rotterdam, while working as an intern at <em>PublishingLab.</em> Apart from working as a graphic designer, the areas she explores are glitch, the subjectivity of reality, and the mere meaning of life. Glitch is approached as a mean to transmit other concepts. She tries to go out of social constructed paradigms, questioning the main structures of believes on which society is build. Her approach is self-reflexive and self-explorative, with the idea that all answers can be found in oneself.</p>
