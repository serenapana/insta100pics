<h1>Curating Identity</h1>
<h2>Fashionable Personae</h2>

	<p>For many, what distinguishes bloggers from the authoritative editors at <em>Vogue</em> or <em>Harper's Bazaar</em> and their commanding perch is the personal voice. While traditional magazines aspire for journalistic integrity and fair criticism, Fashion Instagrammers sacrifice this and indulge followers into the glamorous and fantastical allure of the fashion world. This intimacy is primarily achieved by embracing the voyeurism of social media and strategically constructing a marketable Instagram identity that resonates with their specific audiences.</p>

	<p>Coming from the early blogging traditions, Instagrammers have adopted the platform as a visual diary, inviting users into privileged glimpses of their lives, alongside the glamorous exploits that come as fashion celebrities. And while fashion commentary remains important, it’s infused with carefully revealed personal elements. Pregnancy, friendship, romance and family become the intimate backdrop that permeates the affable peculiarity of their fashion commentary.</p>

	<p>Looking at Instagram through this lens brings forward the question of identity, as well as the importance of self-presentation and strategies of identity formation. While often understood as a permanent and enduring concept, identity should be regarded more as an ephemeral and continuously performative project. As a result, followers can develop intimate relationships with Instagrammers, a particular phenomenon social scientists coin as <span class="popup" onclick="popupone()"><u><em>parasocial relationships</em></u><span class="popuptext" id="myPopupone">Originally developed for "media figure" such as presenters, actors and celebrities, <em>parasocial relationships</em> describe the emotional relationships audiences develop with mass-media figures.</span></span>.</p>

	<p>This understanding therefore can enlighten us on how Instagrammers leverage the platform’s unique politics and structure to construct a digital identity that resonates with followers. Responding to followers, collaborating with other bloggers, using particular #hashtags and repeating specific selfie poses are all important interactions that affirm a digital identity. As a result, this <span class="popup" onclick="popuptwo()"><u><em>fashionable persona</em></u><span class="popuptext" id="myPopuptwo"><b>fashionable personae</b>/ˈfaʃ(ə)nəb(ə)l pəˈsəʊnə/ <br>Defined by cultural critic Monica Titton, her fashionable personae refers to the strategic and performative character developed by bloggers that is a result of negotiations between the blogger’s self-identity and  their appropriation of narrative fragments from fashion.</span></span> produces a crafted intimacy; where Instagrammers leverage the platform’s specific architecture in order to seamlessly blur the boundaries between personal and public personas.</p>
