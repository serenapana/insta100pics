<h1>Monetizing Blogs</h1>
<h2>The Underlying Economy of Fashion Blogging</h2>
	<div class="paragraphone">
	<p>Underneath the glamorous runways, spectacular clothing and extravagant gifts lies the [Like button]: the digital artefact that structures online activity and reconciles sporadic and frantic data flows into measurable and quantifiable commodities. The arrival of this economy underpins the professionalization of blogging and has enabled bloggers to emerge as influential forces within the fashion industry and regulars at global fashions weeks.</br>

As a result, the Like button, along with other online metrics like Followers, Likes, Comments, establishes a bloggers’ cultural relevance and, therefore, determines, their economic bargaining clout.</br>

<div class="paragraphfour">
	<p>This quantification of sociability is what has allowed for the commercialization of digital platforms, with fashion bloggers on Instagram emerging as some of the most visible and lucrative digital workers. This monetization of user engagement functions as the entrepreneurial engine that fuels the growth of fashion bloggers, and grants them front row seats alongside Vogue and other fashion celebrities at fashion weeks.</br>
