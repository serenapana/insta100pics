<h1>Monetizing User Engagement</h1>
<h2>The Underlying Economy of Fashion Blogging</h2>
	<div class="paragraphone">

This monetization of user engagement functions as the entrepreneurial engine that fuels the growth of fashion bloggers, and grants them front row seats alongside Vogue and other fashion celebrities at fashion weeks.</br>
