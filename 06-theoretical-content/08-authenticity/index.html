<h1>Crafting Authenticity</h1>
<h2>How Authenticity Configures Affective Engagement</h2>

	<p>Deeply embedded in the cultural imagination surrounding blogging is a fascination with authenticity. Often demanded within the fashion blogosphere, authenticity seduces users and largely motivates the popular appeal of their content. This is particularly accentuated when contrasted by the anonymity fashion publishing, the ridged exclusivity of the industry and the fickle commodification of fashion, clothing and beauty more generally. Cultivating this authentic branding, whether through the affective relations bloggers form with users, their alleged authorial voice or the way bloggers brazenly flaunt intimate glimpses into their private lives, becomes an essential and strategic instrument.</p>

	<p>However, understanding the underlying economic mechanisms of fashion blogging begins to strain the veracity of the term: How do bloggers reconcile a fetishised emphasis on authenticity within the decidedly commercial context of online fashion blogging?  What does authenticity signify when fashion bloggers are courted by designers, receive invitations to fashion shows, are gifted lavish presents, and granted opportunities to collaborate with fashion labels?

	<p>Captivating philosophers and theorists, authenticity remains an almost fruitlessly difficult concept to grasp and tame. However, in a digital culture saturated with marketing rhetoric and obsessed with celebrity culture, authenticity becomes an invaluable asset for the <em>brand of self expression</em>.</p>

	<p>Within the fashion blogosphere, authenticity is generally understood by followers to mean a vague understanding of editorial independence and not ‘selling out,’ remaining honest and showing clothes that they “really wear.” Peeling back these nebulous qualities, the claim of blogging authenticity matures from the earliest days of blogging, when bloggers remained firmly outside the commercial and corporate structure. This conception has even earlier traces in early utopian ideals of digital culture, where optimism of digitalism promised a deterritorialisation and decentralization of hegemonic structures. However, as the digital economy has matured, its commercial embrace has rendered this original promise dubious. And, as fashion bloggers traverse the precarious hazards of self-commodification, it is important to unpackage our intuitive understandings of authenticity, and challenge the accompanying rhetoric so ubitituous on social media networks.</p>
