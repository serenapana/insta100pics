	<h1>The Blurring Distinctions Between Work and Leisure</h1>
	<h2>"Getting Paid Doing What I Love"</h2>
		
		<p>The growth of the gig economy and prominence of digital labourers catalyzes charged discussions surrounding the conditions and possibilities of creative work. In particular, the digital economy brings to the surface elusive questions regarding the ambiguous space between production and consumption; between labour and leisure; and between professional and amateur.</p>

		This video highlights the deliberate and strategic labour that goes into curating a digital identity, as well as, the diverse tools and techniques available for self-presentation.<p></p>

		<p>Blogging, as a celebrated profession of the "new economy", embodies the glamorous ideals of digital labour, where values of self-governance, entrepreneurism, flexibility, and technological empowerment dominate. And while these celebratory accounts inform the cultural assumptions and expectations surrounding blogging, bloggers also internalize a seductive narrative of DWYL (<em>Do What You Love</em>). This triumphant mantra dangles the prospect a career where labour and leisure harmoniously coexist. Importantly, this affective rationalization conditions neoliberal governance, where low pay and long hours are compensated with ‘creative autonomy,’ and, in the case of bloggers, the manic rhetoric of "getting discovered."</p>  
		
		<p>However, if one removes this romantic lens, blogging’s underlying precarity and instability begin to materialize. Ubiquitous across blogs, the ‘About Me’ sections of blogs are where this digital enabled entrepreneurial logic manifests itself most concretely. There, bloggers obscure their own entrepreneurial aspirations and emphasize an almost mystical inevitability of their fashion blogging careers - borne out of following their hearts and experimenting with digital technology. These narratives of passion are common thematic tropes on fashion blogs, and enlighten us on how bloggers perceive their digital identity, as well as the underlying commercial motives that sustain their passionate output.</p>

		<p>Situating Fashion Instagrammers within this neoliberal critique brings into sharp focus their effortless self-branding and ‘always-on’ blogging identity. Additionally, it challenges their narratives around digital labour and looks to emphasize the obscured and strenuous demands of this supposedly heralded calling.   Appreciating the invested reserves of time, energy and capital required in blogging brings forward the deeply entangled relations between leisure time and labour time, and positions the Fashion Instagrammer as the embodiment of capitalism’s entrenched imperative to continually exploit value.</p>
